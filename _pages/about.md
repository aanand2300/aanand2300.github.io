### About me
Hi! I am Aniket, an incoming M.S. CS student in the [School of Computer Science](https://scs.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). My research interest lies in Distributed Systems. Lately, I have been working on blockchains and fault-tolerant message passing systems. Currently, I am advised by [Dr. Marios Lestas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=OQ_91oUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), [Dr. Waqar Asif](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9-048OwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Davide Frey](http://people.irisa.fr/Davide.Frey/).

During undergraduate, I spent the summer of 2019 working with [Dr. Ta Nguyen Binh Doung](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=sZ44WsUAAAAJ&hl=en) at [NTU, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx). Before that, I spend the summer of 2018 with [FCRLab Team](https://fcrlab.unime.it/people) supervised by [Prof. Massimo Villari](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=LogifUkAAAAJ&hl=en) at [UniME, Italy](https://www.unime.it/en/home).

I earned a B.Tech degree in [Ceramic Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic_engineering) from [IIT (BHU)](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/) in 2020.

If you have any exciting opportunities, please feel free to send me an email!
