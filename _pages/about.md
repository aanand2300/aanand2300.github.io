### About me
Hi! I am Aniket, a first year grad student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) advised by [Professor Alberto Dainotti](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~adainotti6/). I am pursuing [M.S. in Computer Science](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/master-science-computer-science) and working towards Computing Systems specialization. My research interest lies in Internet Measurement, Network Security and Blockchain. My current research is aimed at characterizing Internet Outages in Residential Networks by performing a longitudinal study of probing responses at the Internet-wide scale.

Previously, I analyzed the performance and security of proof-of-work blockchains in wireless setting with [Dr. Marios Lestas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=OQ_91oUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Dr. Waqar Asif](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9-048OwAAAAJ&hl=en). I spent the summer of 2019 interning at [NTU, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) where I worked on a decentralized system for optimizing air-traffic flow with [Dr. Ta Nguyen Binh Doung](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=sZ44WsUAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I spend the summer of 2018 with [FCRLab Team](https://fcrlab.unime.it/people) supervised by [Prof. Massimo Villari](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=LogifUkAAAAJ&hl=en) at [UniME, Italy](https://www.unime.it/en/home) where I built cryptographic primitives at the network edge and in IoT devices for securing inter-domain communication.

I earned a B.Tech degree in [Ceramic Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic_engineering) from [IIT (BHU)](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/) in 2020.

If you have any exciting research ideas/opportunities in the domain of Networking Systems or Security/Privacy I would be happy to get in touch or even if you just want to say Hi, feel free to reach out :)
