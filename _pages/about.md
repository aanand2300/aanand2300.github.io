### About me
Hi! I am Aniket, a first year grad student pursuing [M.S. in Computer Science](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/master-science-computer-science) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). I am working towards Systems Specialization and my research interest lies in Systems and Security. Currently, I am working on Internet Measurement for Residential ASN with [Professor Alberto Dainotti](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~adainotti6/).

Previously, I have explored blockchains and wireless networking with [Dr. Marios Lestas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=OQ_91oUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Dr. Waqar Asif](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9-048OwAAAAJ&hl=en). I spent the summer of 2019 interning at [NTU, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) where I worked on privacy and optimization in air-traffic flow management with [Dr. Ta Nguyen Binh Doung](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=sZ44WsUAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I spend the summer of 2018 with [FCRLab Team](https://fcrlab.unime.it/people) supervised by [Prof. Massimo Villari](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=LogifUkAAAAJ&hl=en) at [UniME, Italy](https://www.unime.it/en/home) exploring the secure interdoamin communication with IoT.

I earned a B.Tech degree in [Ceramic Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic_engineering) from [IIT (BHU)](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/) in 2020.

If you have any exciting opportunity or just want to say Hello :), please feel free to send me an email!
